Welcome back to the SynapseGarden blog in the year 2016!  We'll unfold our near-
term plans for Mindfork and its users.

## Plans

Things have been slow for SG over the Christmas holidays.  Today we had a brief
team meeting to get back on our feet, and plotted out a few plans for the next
few weeks.

SynapseGarden has a number of projects on the back burner.
We've been working on and off for some time on a concept for a game inspired by
[Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/), a truly remarkable
"roguelike" world simulator.  This week we're evaluating engine options to make
a serious go of it, and sketching up an extensible client/server model for
multi-player.  We have a bit of preliminary client content on our Github at
https://github.com/synapse-garden/phoenix and
https://github.com/synapse-garden/phoenix-cxx.  We are considering switching to
Unreal Engine for more efficient work, but the game universe is highly
procedural.  More research is required.

On the Mindfork front, we'll be adding TLS to all of our webservices, to match
our site.  We also will be striking forward on a main site at
https://synapsegarden.net.  Hopefully we'll have some great content for you on
that topic next week!

## Progress

We've updated the SG Weblog to exclusively use HTTPS.  We host on
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), so it was a bit of an adventure to get
our custom URL working.  We ended up using
[CloudFlare's](https://cloudflare.com) static site caching, which offers the
option to default to HTTPS on page view.

### Stay tuned!
