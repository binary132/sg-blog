&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to the SynapseGarden blog in the year 2016!  We&amp;rsquo;ll unfold our near-
term plans for Mindfork and its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;plans:26d60b987087598cf4f2d6dedb251778&#34;&gt;Plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have been slow for SG over the Christmas holidays.  Today we had a brief
team meeting to get back on our feet, and plotted out a few plans for the next
few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SynapseGarden has a number of projects on the back burner.
We&amp;rsquo;ve been working on and off for some time on a concept for a game inspired by
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/&#34;&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, a truly remarkable
&amp;ldquo;roguelike&amp;rdquo; world simulator.  This week we&amp;rsquo;re evaluating engine options to make
a serious go of it, and sketching up an extensible client/server model for
multi-player.  We have a bit of preliminary client content on our Github at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/synapse-garden/phoenix&#34;&gt;https://github.com/synapse-garden/phoenix&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/synapse-garden/phoenix-cxx&#34;&gt;https://github.com/synapse-garden/phoenix-cxx&lt;/a&gt;.  We are considering switching to
Unreal Engine for more efficient work, but the game universe is highly
procedural.  More research is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Mindfork front, we&amp;rsquo;ll be adding TLS to all of our webservices, to match
our site.  We also will be striking forward on a main site at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://synapsegarden.net&#34;&gt;https://synapsegarden.net&lt;/a&gt;.  Hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll have some great content for you on
that topic next week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;progress:26d60b987087598cf4f2d6dedb251778&#34;&gt;Progress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve updated the SG Weblog to exclusively use HTTPS.  We host on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com&#34;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;, so it was a bit of an adventure to get
our custom URL working.  We ended up using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloudflare.com&#34;&gt;CloudFlare&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; static site caching, which offers the
option to default to HTTPS on page view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;stay-tuned:26d60b987087598cf4f2d6dedb251778&#34;&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In which a brief overview of current SG software and roadmap is given.  This
week’s adventures: Dart, Polymer, and Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello again.  This week our attention has been focused on creating a small
browser client for the prototype Mindfork backend we have running here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;source&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;https://blog.synapsegarden.net/script/js/source.dart.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;polymer-dart-does-not-play-well-with-others:6bce3dfe5168a762038ec36830bc213f&#34;&gt;Polymer-Dart: does not play well with others.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SynapseGarden Weblog is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; blog hosted on Github
Pages.  Embedded scripts must therefore require minimal modification to HTML
content, since it is generated from Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sets the expectations well for our web client.  Right now we’re working
out the details of our client architecture, but there are some basic
requirements out the gate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must provide easily distributed reusable standalone components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These components must be usable together in a greater app context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These components must offer backend connectors for Mindfork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We therefore kept these elements at the forefront during the week’s work with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dart-lang/polymer-dart&#34;&gt;Polymer-Dart&lt;/a&gt;.  Alas, it is far
from a match made in heaven.  While Polymer-Dart seems to meet our needs
nicely, the reality is that it has strong expectations about the structure
and content of the entire site it works within, to the extent that it
generates the HTML index which it expects to work with, with significant
mangling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible this could be picked apart and found to be workable, and we’d
love for it to be.  However, it doesn’t look like this is the framework we
need for Dash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-week:6bce3dfe5168a762038ec36830bc213f&#34;&gt;This week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next section is a brief overview of our week exploring Polymer-Dart for
our Dash frontend.  In this section, we’ll outline what we’re working on this
week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, we have a simple prototype Mindfork service running at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mfp.synapsegarden.net:25000&#34;&gt;https://mfp.synapsegarden.net:25000&lt;/a&gt;.  The source is linked above; we
encourage you to review the API and open a pull request if you see anything
you’d like to add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we’re pushing forward on offering an embedded web login
panel and a few other features (e.g.  password reset) so that logins can be
handed out and automated collaboration begin in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dash-you-say:6bce3dfe5168a762038ec36830bc213f&#34;&gt;Dash you say?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dash is a concept we’ve been hammering out for some time, for a very
atteries-included framework for building apps which make use of Mindfork
backends.  Since SynapseGarden’s community and development will be driven by
the Mindfork backend, Dash will be used extensively in our web UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If our goal was to build our own webapp and backend, the obvious choice would
be to use an existing set of tools; Ember, Angular, React, and many others
offer excellent options for anyone who wants to build a particular frontend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what we’re really looking to do is to provide tools for people to
build &lt;em&gt;with minimal effort&lt;/em&gt; web applications that make use of community-driven
data on the Mindfork model.  That means collaboration, human networking, and
behavioral optimization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all of the aforementioned options may prove to be useful to this end,
what we will distribute to developers who wish to use Mindfork will not look
like a Javascript framework.  It may be a library, similar to d3js, which
intelligent data-driven elements can be used from in simple (or complex)
Javascript.  It may be a set of &lt;a href=&#34;http://webcomponents.org/&#34;&gt;Web Components&lt;/a&gt;.
Our options are still open; however, we recently made the tough decision to
abandon our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/synapse-garden/dash-cljs&#34;&gt;Clojurescript frontend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dart-you-say:6bce3dfe5168a762038ec36830bc213f&#34;&gt;Dart you say?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe Dart offers a highly-structured and easily-tested systematic
approach to web application development.  While we want to offer an easy and
usable API to people who want to use Dash, we don’t particularly care that
it’s easy to open the hood and muck about with.  Most users should not have to
do that; those who do are intelligent enough to learn Dart, which is a very
easy and usable language from what little we’ve experienced.  Like Go, it
offers quite excellent tooling out of the box, and does not require any
third-party software besides the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dartlang.org/&#34;&gt;Dart SDK&lt;/a&gt;.
There’s an excellent plugin for Intellij IDEA, if that’s your style;
otherwise, everything in the Dart SDK is comfortable to use from the command
line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the needs of our community come first and foremost; we are also
considering ES6, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://x-tag.github.io/&#34;&gt;X-Tag Web Components&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;see-you-next-week:6bce3dfe5168a762038ec36830bc213f&#34;&gt;See you next week!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, and welcome to SynapseGarden: a new network for collaborative creation,
both online and in the flesh.  Here, you’ll find our thoughts and plans,
updated early each Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what:2cc7dc244eed4480e8b46c91e911e96b&#34;&gt;What?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SynapseGarden is a fully free and open platform for a new human ecosystem,
using technologies devised to empower the construction of communities.  The
first such community, to which we now invite you, revolves around code;
building upon that foundation, we will push to enable real-world projects and
localized human networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SynapseGarden will always work tirelessly to be, and to remain, the prime
example of such a community.  Ultimately, however, our true hope is that this
technology will enable many, many, many such communities, wherever people need
or wish to organize and collaborate.  Our purpose is to act as leaders among a
brilliant and powerful metacommunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our first public statement of purpose.  Now, we’d like to invite you
to join in.  There’s a great deal to be done, but many hands make light work.
The reward for this labor is simple but powerful: leadership in a community of
leaders, and access to labor according to your contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why:2cc7dc244eed4480e8b46c91e911e96b&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crowd labor isn’t, and shouldn’t be free unless it’s donated.  All labor is
valuable.  Your mind is valuable.  Your ideas are valuable.  We won’t ask or
expect you to give these things away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our foundation is a repeatable, efficient, and scientific process we’ve
designed around the needs of such communities: Mindfork.  Mindfork is a
simple, self-repeating collaboration pattern, which applies principles of
computing to organic, human work.  We’re building the seed of this technology
using Google’s Go language, and we’d love to have you along, whether you’re an
expert or a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindfork is free software (under Affero GPL), which means its licensing
preserves your rights to use and modify it as you wish.  Anyone can download
its source code and use it for themselves as they please, as long as their
modifications do not interfere with these rights.  We’d like to give this
software to everyone, because when more people join in a free ecosystem, we
can all share in more data.  We can all learn more about how people interact
in communities, and we can all use that knowledge to build better communities,
together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;see-you-around:2cc7dc244eed4480e8b46c91e911e96b&#34;&gt;See you around.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you’ve enjoyed learning about what we’re doing, and what is yet to
come.  We’ll soon have more content up at &lt;a href=&#34;http://synapsegarden.net&#34;&gt;http://synapsegarden.net&lt;/a&gt;; until
then, you can visit our Github at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/synapse-garden&#34;&gt;https://github.com/synapse-garden&lt;/a&gt; to see
some of the projects we’ve been working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can sign up here for more info, and access to our closed alpha services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;reg-email&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;reg-button&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;output&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;https://blog.synapsegarden.net/script/js/simple-reg.dart.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;have-a-great-week:2cc7dc244eed4480e8b46c91e911e96b&#34;&gt;Have a great week!&lt;/h3&gt;
